# Startup Jobs Listing Web Scraper
## Project Overview

This project is a job posting web scraper that collects job details — including the job title, company name, location, job description, and apply link — from Zepto's careers page. The frontend is built using React.js, where each job is displayed as a card. When a user clicks on a card, a summarized version of the job description is shown.

The backend is developed with Django and is responsible for scraping job data and handling communication between the frontend and backend via GET and POST API requests. Job descriptions are summarized using DeepSeek AI to ensure they are concise and user-friendly.
